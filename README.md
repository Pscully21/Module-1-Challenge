# Module-1-Challenge, Developing the Horiseon Website

  
  Throughout this module I have learned lots about the importance of how concise and clean both HTML and CSS files should be. Cleaning up the HTML file showed me how confusing code can be when working with lots of needless div inputs. When going though and changing some to the section semantic, it make it a lot easier to read both in the HTML file itself and also on the Inspect page. 
  
  The CSS in this homework also showed some needless lines of code that I would bunch together using commas. This made the CSS a lot shorter and neater when going through it. Applying the CSS code into the HTML file once I sifted through what I did and didn't need was necessary so i could see how they related to different semantics in the HTML file. This module challenge really helped me better understand certain critical aspects of HTML and CSS.
